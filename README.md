# Chon
Get Sean (Chone) to finally pick something to watch while we wait for this pandemic to end society as we know it!

Chon is an Android (possibly iOS in the future) app developed with a single purpose in mind: spend less time scrolling through Netflix and more time indulging in self-destructive and indulgent lifestyles. This app features several slices that can take up a wheel, and the wheel is spun to allow users to randomly decide on a place to eat, movie to watch, or TV show to blare in the background of playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
